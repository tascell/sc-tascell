* SC Preprocessor directives

* (%include <file-name>)
corresponds to an #include directive in C.
The file <file-name> is included.

* (%cinclude <cfile-name>)
<Cfile-name> specifies a C header file.
The C code is compiled into SC-0 and the result is spliced there.
The SC programmers can use library functions and most of macros
such as \|printf| and \|NULL| declared/\|#define|d in C header files.

* (%rule (<rule-set1> ... <rule-setn>))
is available only in the first application of SC preprocessor.
This directive specifies the list of rule-sets which the SC program being compiled
to be applied.
Each <rule-setk> is a keyword symbol which specifies a rule-set (e.g. :nestfunc)
or a keyword symbol with arguments to the rule-set (e.g., (:nestfunc :all-in-estack ALL-IN-ESTACK)).
The :rule keyword parameter of sc2c function, if supplied, overwrites setting of this directive.

* (%defmacro <symbol> <lambda-list> <S-exp> ...)
evaluated as a defmacro form of Common Lisp to define an SC macro.
After the definition,
every list in the form of (<symbol> ...) is replaced with
the result of the application of Common Lisp's macroexpand-1 function
to the list.
The algorithm to expand nested macro applications
complies with the standard C specification.

* (%defconstant <symbol> <S-exp>)
defines an SC macro in the same way as a %defmacro directive,
except that every symbol which "eq"s <symbol> is
replaced with <S-exp> after the definition.

* (%undef <symbol>)
undefines the specified macro defined by %defmacros or %defconstants.

* (%ifdef  <symbol> (<body1>) (<body2>))
* (%ifndef <symbol> (<body1>) (<body2>))
If the macro specified (not specified) by <symbol> is defined, <body1> is spliced there.
Otherwise <body2> is spliced.

* (%if <constant> (<body1>) (<body2>))
<constant> is macro-expanded, and then the result is evaluated by Common Lisp.
If the return value "eql"s nil or 0, <body2> is spliced there.
Otherwise <body1> is spliced.

* (%ifdef* <symbol> <body1_1> ... <body1_m> %else <body2_1> ... <body2_n>)
* (%ifndef* <symbol> <body1_1> ... <body1_m> %else <body2_1> ... <body2_n>)
* (%if* <constant> <body1_1> ... <body1_m> %else <body2_1> ... <body2_n>)
equivalent to
- (%ifdef <symbol> (<body1_1> ... <body1_m>) (<body2_1> ... <body2_n>))
- (%ifndef <symbol> (<body1_1> ... <body1_m>) (<body2_1> ... <body2_n>))
- (%if <constant> (<body1_1> ... <body1_m>) (<body2_1> ... <body2_n>))
respectively.

* (%error <string> <s-exp> ...)
interrupts the compilation with an error message.
The message is an evaluation result of (format *error-output* <string> <s-exp>).
