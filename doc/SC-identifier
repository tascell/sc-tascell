* Notes about Identifiers in SC-0/1 (and almost of extended SC languages)

1. Hyphens in an SC identifier
All hyphens (#\-) in an SC identifier are translated to underbars (#\_) by an SC preprocessor.
ex. --time-- --> __time__
ex. --time__ --> __time__

2. Correspondense between SC identifiers and C identifiers
All SC code (and patterns in .rule files) are read in a readtable environment
where readtable-case is set to :invert.
A C identifier is created by inverting case of the print name of a Lisp symbol
when all the alphabets in the symbol are of the same case, otherwise
no modification is applied.

(example)
SC              print-name (of CL)      C
-----------------------------------------------
abc             "ABC"                   abc
Abc             "Abc"                   aBC
NULL            "null"                  NULL
null            "NULL"                  null
FreeBSD         "FreeBSD"               FreeBSD
